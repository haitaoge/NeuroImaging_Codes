Pipeline for NeuroImaging

Go to the Wiki page or go to https://github.com/mrhunsaker/NeuroImaging_Codes/wiki/Neuro-Pipeline-Wiki to get to the wiki for my neuroimaging pipelines.

I try to focus as much as possible on free, open source command line tools that are based on ITK and VTK libraries.  

There is a lot of work yet to do so I will be regularly updating this wiki page to reflect my personal state of the art for my imaging methods.

Please feel free to contact me at mrhunsaker @ icloud.com if there are any questions
