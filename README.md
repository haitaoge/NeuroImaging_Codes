NeuroImaging_Codes
==================

Pipeline for NeuroImaging

Go to the Wiki page or go to https://github.com/mrhunsaker/NeuroImaging_Codes.wiki.git to get to the wiki for my neuroimaging pipelines.

I try to focus as much as possible on free, open source command line tools that are based on ITK and VTK libraries.  

Please feel free to contact me at mrhunsaker @ icloud.com if there are any questions
